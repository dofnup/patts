# Welcome to my patterns!

Hi! This repo was created based on an [idea](https://www.tumblr.com/smalltestaccount/742254971787083776/whats-stopping-you-from-doing-this) from Tumblr user @smalltestaccount, to have a "yarn" GitHub. I HAD to try it.


## Files

Currently, there is a `crochet` directory and a `knitting` directory. I do not currently have any knitting patterns that I have written, but hey, maybe someday.
