**DISCLAIMER**: this is technically not "my" pattern.

The pattern I'm using is no longer available, don't know why. It was called Beth's Baby Starghan. I first used it 15 years ago (!) to make a starghan for my firstborn. I have since made many starghans and I memorized the pattern. So I don't need to refer back to it. Along the way I have also made 3 key mods, which I will go into.

Let's do this!

A star is made up of peaks and valleys. Peaks are 3dc,2ch,3dc shells. Valleys are skip 2 stitches.

**Round 0**: magic loop, 5 3dc clusters separated by 2ch
![round 0-1](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ac45dda268342608d199cc795e28e1e5/69387e938e87f08c-30/s1280x1920/b2b013c43e127d8c3e8ee412c71569ac227c4356.jpg)
Tighten loop. This should form a pentagony shape. This was my first mod, the original started with just 5 dcs in the loops, which made for a very hole-y center.

For **Round 1**: join to top of ch3 from previous row, and here's my second mod: instead of immediately doing a ch3 to start the next round, slip stitch twice to get to the next peak (2ch space). Then do a ch3 there, counting as the first dc in the shell. Finish the shell.

This helps "hide" the ch3s in the peaks, rather than having them at the valleys and sometimes causing something that looks like a double hole.

Once you have made the first shell, go straight to making the next shell in the next ch2 space. **Round 2** is just 5 shells.

At the end of the row, join with slip stitch to first ch3, and again slip stitch to the ch2 space.

**Round 3**: ch3 (counts as first dc), finish the shell.
![round 3](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6645f68fdce69fb4439411a3b98436ce/69387e938e87f08c-da/s1280x1920/b75810dea7bc2196558462d0bb938309e417b1a9.jpg)
Note! Tricky bit coming up!

When you have completed the shell, you will need to dc into the first dc from the previous round. Sometimes the loop for this dc is "swallowed" or hidden by the shell. So you may need to scrunch the shell to reveal the loop. This is important so you have the same number of dcs on each side of the peaks.

For this round, you will do 2dcs. Then you come to middle of the valley. You will skip two stitches.
![first valley](https://64.media.tumblr.com/822d0d9fde3c6f6cb5777417a202ae56/69387e938e87f08c-dd/s1280x1920/e7b2251e7c16004c5f309d6d15ad11d5058c0128.jpg)
Then you will make 2 dcs again, and you should be at the next 2ch space to make the next shell. 
![round 3 shell](https://64.media.tumblr.com/068a95133e490381618b4990fc5e4e72/69387e938e87f08c-77/s1280x1920/c8755884101741aaa2153e63210e2e37abb9dc77.jpg)
Round 3 is shell, 2dcs, skip 2 stitches, 2dcs, shell, around.
![round 3 done](https://64.media.tumblr.com/7903ddb9d671c4b243dbb4f5a5d4db53/cfb2d96bced7aaff-a8/s1280x1920/a1af4970cae4b13e8020508792ff697d81a97720.jpg)
**Round 4** and the rest: this is where I usually stop counting. I just do shell, dcs until the middle 2 stitches (which should be visible as the 2 skipped stitches from the previous row), skip 2 stitches, dcs until the next shell. But for reference, Round 4 should be shell, 4dcs, skip 2 stitches, 4dcs, shell. If you want to count, every subsequent row should increase each side by 2 stitches, and you always skip the middle 2 stitches.

And there you go! For babies I usually stop around 20 rounds. That's how big my firstborn's first starghan is and it's still their lovey. But you can make them as large as you want. Just keep in mind that every round eats more yarn than the previous! i made a huge starghan for myself and it was really slow going on those last rounds. The baby ones are more of an instant gratification ;)
